<h3>Roadmap</h3>
The Roadmap I mention here is according to my schedule, I have put in long hours to get this done as soon as possible. So yes. Suit yourself.
<h4>Day 1-5</h4>
It should be enough to cover the basics of HTML/CSS. Few things you should deifinitely cover with CSS are positioning, flex-box or grid system, and basic image and text manipulation. If you want to skip the hazzel of making your website responive, learn bootstrap, its easy and will save a lot of your time. Spend a day or day and a half on HTML and rest on CSS.
