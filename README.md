It should be enough to cover the basics of HTML/CSS. Few things you should deifinitely cover with CSS are positioning, flex-box or grid system, and basic image and text manipulation. If you want to skip the hazzel of making your website responive, learn bootstrap, its easy and will save a lot of your time.
