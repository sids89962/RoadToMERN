<h3>Roadmap</h3>
The Roadmap I mention here is according to my schedule, I have put in long hours to get this done as soon as possible. So yes. Suit yourself.
<h4>Day 1-5</h4>
It should be enough to cover the basics of HTML/CSS. Few things you should deifinitely cover with CSS are positioning, flex-box or grid system, and basic image and text manipulation. If you want to skip the hazzel of making your website responive, learn bootstrap, its easy and will save a lot of your time. Spend a day or day and a half on HTML and rest on CSS. Don't waste your time doing fancy CSS things, save that for later.

<h4>Day 6-20</h4>
<strong>Javascript</strong> This is the what you have to master, rest everything will be a piece of cake. If you have studied any programming languages before, forget them because the way javascript works is quite different. And the possibilities it holds are endless. Stay motivated, you won't see any practical results for first 10 days but trust me you will.
